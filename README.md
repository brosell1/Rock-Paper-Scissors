# Rock-Paper-Scissors 🌑📝✂️
### My attempt at a game of rock paper scissors in javascript (with a couple of extra rules)

* Begin the game by entering your name, then press the play button to begin play.

* Type your choice into the prompt window - remember to use precise spelling and capitalisation.

* Results are printed to the console, complete with victory quotes for the computer.

* You are guaranteed to win if you name yourself "Ben". This was simply a test of my coding skills and nothing to do with my fragile ego.

* Similarly, there are two secret choices in the game - "Gun" is guaranteed to win, and "Spoon" is guaranteed to lose.
